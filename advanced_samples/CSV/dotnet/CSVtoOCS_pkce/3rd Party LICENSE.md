Corporation for the ACME software product identified above, which includes
computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, and

also includes any updates and supplements to the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT
provided to you by ACME. Any software provided along with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
that is associated with a separate end-user license agreement is licensed to you
under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, copying, downloading,
accessing, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the
terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install
or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; you may, however, return it to your place of
purchase for a full refund.

## SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright
treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE
PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:

   - Applications Software. You may install, use, access, display, run, or
     otherwise interact with ("RUN") one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, or any
     prior version for the same operating system, on a single computer,
     workstation, terminal, handheld PC, pager, "smart phone," or other
     digital electronic device ("COMPUTER"). The primary user of the COMPUTER
     on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is installed may make a second copy for his
     or her exclusive use on a portable computer.

   - Reservation of Rights. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by
     ACME.

2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.

   - Not for Resale Software. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled "Not For
     Resale" or "NFR," then, notwithstanding other sections of this EULA, your
     use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is limited to use for demonstration, test, or
     evaluation purposes and you may not resell, or otherwise transfer for
     value, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

   - Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly. You
     may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT,
     except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted
     by applicable law.

   - Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a single
     product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than
     one COMPUTER.

   - Trademarks. This EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with
     any trademarks or service marks of ACME.

   - Rental. You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

   - Support Services. ACME may provide you with support services related to
     the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Support Services"). Use of Support Services is
     governed by the ACME policies and programs described in the user manual,
     in "online" documentation, and/or in other ACME-provided materials. Any
     supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support
     Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to
     the terms and conditions of this EULA.

   - Software Transfer. The initial licensee of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may make
     a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT only
     directly to an end user. This transfer must include all of the SOFTWARE
     PRODUCT (including all component parts, the media and printed materials,
     any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of
     Authenticity). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any
     other indirect transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must
     agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not
     to further transfer this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

   - Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, ACME may terminate
     this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
     EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
     and all of its component parts.

3. COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video,
   audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT),
   the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   are owned by ACME or its suppliers. All title and intellectual property
   rights in and to the content that may be accessed through use of the SOFTWARE
   PRODUCT is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected
   by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.
   This EULA grants you no rights to use such content. If this SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   contains documentation that is provided only in electronic form, you may
   print one copy of such electronic documentation. You may not copy the printed
   materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

4. BACKUP COPY. After installation of one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant
   to this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
   was provided by ACME solely for backup or archival purposes. If the original
   media is required to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the COMPUTER, you may make

   or restricted the export of goods or services, which currently include, but
   are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
   and Syria, or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who
   intends to transmit or transport the Restricted Components back to such
   country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to know
   will utilize the Restricted Components in the design, development or
   production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person
   or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export
   transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant and

ACME warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in
accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90)
days from the date of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided by ACME
shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to
you by ACME, and ACME support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts
to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow
limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not
apply to you.

CUSTOMER REMEDIES. ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive
remedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or
(b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs
Limited Warranty and which is returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This
Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from
accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be
warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
whichever is longer.

NO OTHER WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND
ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.
THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH
VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
event shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,
damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability
to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support
Services, even if ACME has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In
any case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this EULA shall be
limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE
PRODUCT or U.S. \$5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support
Services Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be
governed by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do
not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not
apply to you.

# Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Redistributable EULA

IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY - These Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") operating
system components, including any "online" or electronic documentation ("OS
Components") are subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement under which
you have licensed the applicable Microsoft operating system product described
below (each an "End User License Agreement" or "EULA") and the terms and
conditions of this Supplemental EULA. BY INSTALLING, COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING
THE OS COMPONENTS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
APPLICABLE OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCT EULA AND THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY OR USE THE OS
COMPONENTS.

NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALIDLY LICENSED COPY OF ANY VERSION OR EDITION OF
MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95, WINDOWS 98, WINDOWS NT 4.0 WINDOWS 2000 OPERATING SYSTEM OR
ANY MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS A SUCCESSOR TO ANY OF THOSE OPERATING
SYSTEMS (each an "OS Product"), YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INSTALL, COPY OR
OTHERWISE USE THE OS COMPONENTS AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNDER THIS SUPPLEMENTAL
EULA.

Capitalized terms used in this Supplemental EULA and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the applicable OS Product EULA.

General. Each of the OS Components available from this site is identified as
being applicable to one or more of the OS Products. The applicable OS Components
are provided to you by Microsoft to update, supplement, or replace existing
functionality of the applicable OS Product. Microsoft grants you a license to use
the applicable OS Components under the terms and conditions of the EULA for the
applicable OS Product (which are hereby incorporated by reference except as set
forth below), the terms and conditions set forth in this Supplemental EULA, and
the terms and conditions of any additional end user license agreement that may
accompany the individual OS Components (each an "Individual EULA"), provided that
you comply with all such terms and conditions. To the extent that there is a
conflict among any of these terms and conditions applicable to the OS Components,
the following hierarchy shall apply:

1.  the terms and conditions of the Individual EULA;

2.  the terms and conditions in this Supplemental EULA; and

3.  the terms and conditions of the applicable OS Product EULA.

## Additional Rights and Limitations.

- If you have multiple validly licensed copies of any OS Product, you may
  reproduce, install and use one copy of the applicable OS Components as part
  of the applicable OS Product on all of your computers running validly
  licensed copies of the applicable OS Product, provided that you use such
  additional copies of such OS Components in accordance with the terms and
  conditions above. For each validly licensed copy of the applicable OS
  Product, you also may reproduce one additional copy of the applicable OS
  Components solely for archival purposes or reinstallation of the OS
  Components on the same computer as the OS Components were previously
  installed. Microsoft retains all right, title and interest in and to the OS
  Components. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Microsoft.

- If you are installing the OS Components on behalf of an organization other
  than your own, prior to installing any of the OS Components, you must confirm
  that the end-user (whether an individual or a single entity) has received,
  read and accepted these terms and conditions.

- The OS Components may contain technology that enables applications to be
  shared between two or more computers, even if an application is installed on
  only one of the computers. You may use this technology with all Microsoft
  application products for multi-party conferences. For non-Microsoft
  applications, you should consult the accompanying license agreement or
  contact the licensor to determine whether application sharing is permitted by
  the licensor.

- You may conduct internal benchmark testing of the .NET Framework component of
  the OS Components (".NET Component"). You may disclose the results of any
  benchmark test of the .NET Component, provided that you comply with the
  following terms:

  1.  you must disclose all the information necessary for replication of the
      tests, including complete and accurate details of your benchmark testing
      methodology, the test scripts/cases, tuning parameters applied, hardware
      and software platforms tested, the name and version number of any third
      party testing tool used to conduct the testing, and complete source code
      for the benchmark suite/harness that is developed by or for you and used
      to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s);

  2.  you must disclose the date(s) that you conducted the benchmark tests,
      along with specific version information for all Microsoft software
      products tested, including the .NET Component;

  3.  your benchmark testing was performed using all performance tuning and
      best practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and/or on
      Microsoft's support web sites, and uses the latest updates, patches and
      fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant Microsoft
      operating system;

  4.  it shall be sufficient if you make the disclosures provided for above
      at a publicly available location such as a website, so long as every
      public disclosure of the results of your benchmark test expressly
      identifies the public site containing all required disclosures; and

  5.  nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other right that
      you may have to conduct benchmark testing.


    The foregoing obligations shall not apply to your disclosure of the results
    of any customized benchmark test of the .NET Component, whereby such
    disclosure is made under confidentiality in conjunction with a bid request by
    a prospective customer, such customer's application(s) are specifically
    tested and the results are only disclosed to such specific customer.
    Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have with Microsoft, if you
    disclose such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to
    disclose the results of benchmark tests it conducts of your products that
    compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same
    conditions above.

WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, THE LIMITED WARRANTY (IF ANY) INCLUDED IN THE
APPLICABLE OS PRODUCT EULA APPLIES TO THE APPLICABLE OS COMPONENTS PROVIDED THE
APPLICABLE OS COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN LICENSED BY YOU WITHIN THE TERM OF THE LIMITED
WARRANTY IN THE APPLICABLE OS PRODUCT EULA. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA DOES

        le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes
        tiers ; et

      *  les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au
        titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d'une autre faute dans
        la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

    Elle s'applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
    l'éventualité d'un tel dommage. Si votre pays n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou
    la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou
    de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion
    ci-dessus ne s'appliquera pas à votre égard.

    EFFET JURIDIQUE.  Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
    pourriez avoir d'autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
    contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays
